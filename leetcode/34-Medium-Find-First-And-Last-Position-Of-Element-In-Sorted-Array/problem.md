# Problem 34: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

#### Difficulty: Medium

#### Problem

Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

#### Example

<pre>

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8

Output: [3,4]
