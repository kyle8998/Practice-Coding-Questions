# Problem 39: Combination Sum


#### Difficulty: Medium

#### Problem

Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

#### Example

<pre>

Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [1, 7],
  [1, 2, 5],
  [2, 6],
  [1, 1, 6]
]
</pre>

**Note:**

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.

The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
