# Problem 268: Missing Number

#### Difficulty: Easy

#### Problem

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Note:

Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

#### Example

Example 1:

Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
