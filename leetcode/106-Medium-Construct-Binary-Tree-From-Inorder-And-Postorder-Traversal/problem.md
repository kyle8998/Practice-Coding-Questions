# Problem 106: Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal


#### Difficulty: Medium

#### Problem

Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note:**

You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

#### Example

<pre>

inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]

postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]

</pre>

Return the following binary tree:

<pre>

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
   
</pre>
