#### Difficulty: Medium

#### Problem

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that
a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

#### Example

<pre>

For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
