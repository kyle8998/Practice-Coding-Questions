# Problem 237: Delete Node in a Linked List

#### Difficulty: Easy

#### Problem

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

    4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9

#### Example

<pre>
Example 1:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
             
Example 2:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
