# Problem 105: Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal


#### Difficulty: Medium

#### Problem

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note:**

You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

#### Example

<pre>

preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]

inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]

</pre>

Return the following binary tree:

<pre>

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
   
</pre>
