# Problem 123: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III


#### Difficulty: Hard

#### Problem

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

#### Example

<pre>
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]

Output: 6

Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
</pre>
