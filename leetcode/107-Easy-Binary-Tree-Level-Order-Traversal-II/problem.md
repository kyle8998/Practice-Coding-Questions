# Problem 107: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II


#### Difficulty: Easy

#### Problem

Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

#### Example

<pre>

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
   
return its bottom-up level order traversal as:

[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]

</pre>
