# Problem 39: Combination Sum


#### Difficulty: Medium

#### Problem

Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

#### Example

<pre>

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]

</pre>

**Note:**

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.

The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
